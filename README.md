# Doc Detective Workshop

Welcome to the **Doc Detective Workshop**! This repository is a sandbox for our team to get hands-on experience writing automated tests for our Redpanda docs using [Doc Detective](https://example.com/doc-detective-docs). The goal here is to practice writing tests and learn how to simulate user interactions in our docs. At the end of this workshop, we'll have our complete Serverless quickstart set up with automated testing.

## Introduction

In this workshop, you'll write tests using Doc Detective. These tests simulate real user interactions, such as logging in, navigating, and filling forms, so that we can ensure our docs remain user-friendly and error-free.

**Goals:**

- Learn the basics of writing automated tests.
- Understand how to set up and run tests.
- Experiment with different test steps and actions.

---

## How tests work

Tests use a JSON format where each test is a series of steps. Each step defines an action, such as:

- setVariables: Loads environment variables for future test steps to use.
- goTo: Navigates to a specific URL.
- find: Locates elements on the page and optionally clicks them.
- typeKeys: Simulates typing (including special keys like $ENTER$).
- wait: Pauses test execution, for example to wait for a page to finish loading.

## Agenda

Below is the agenda for our workshop. This schedule is a rough guide and may be adjusted based on feedback and progress:

1. Introduction (10 min)

1. Demo: Login test (10 min)

1. Hands-on challenge (30 min)

1. Break (10 min)

1. Review and discussion (30 min)

## Get started with the challenge

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JakeSCahill/redpanda-doc-detective-training.git
   cd redpanda-doc-detective-training
   ```

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

1. Add the password to the `.env` file (you'll be told what this password is during the workshop):

    ```ini
    PASSWORD=<password>
    ```

1. Run the example:

    ```bash
    cd challenge
    npx doc-detective runTests --input cloud-login.json
    ```

A `screenshots/login.png` image was autogenerated and saved to your local filesystem.
Notice how the image shows a modal. But, you want to be able to test creating a topic is Cloud and take a screenshot of the final result.

## Repository structure

This repository is organized to help you progressively build your testing skills. Here’s an overview of the structure:
